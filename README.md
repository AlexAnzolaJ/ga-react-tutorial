# Setup (Before Class)

## Make sure you have the following tools:
- A Mac computer (Linix and Windows welcome, but I'll be able to offer very limited support if any issues pop up, especially with Windows)
- An IDE (Sublime, Atom, VIM or something similar)
- Google Chrome or FireFox
- Node.js installed

## Steps to take before class

### If you don't have Node.js installed
If you've already installed node, you can skip this step.

- Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and download node 4.2.4 (or the latest version of 4.x.x). Don't download version 5.x.x unless you know what you're doing.
- Open the installer and follow the instructions.

### Once node is installed

1. Clone this repo, then in terminal enter the following commands
2.  `git clone git@github.com:goopscoop/ga-react-tutorial.git`
3. `cd ga-react-tutorial`
4.  `npm install`
5.  `npm start`
6. In your web browser, enter the url `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/#/`. 
- You should see a bar at the top of the page that says "App ready." Below that, it'll say "Hello General Assembly. Welcome to React". If you see this, you're ready for class.
- If you don't see this, please let me know at the beginning of class.
- If you feel adventurous, go ahead and poke around the files. Most of what you'll find is general boilerplate that will make your dev experiance nicer.
